## Ansible

Ansible is an open-source automation tool designed for managing and configuring computer systems and software applications. It simplifies the process of automating tasks such as provisioning servers, deploying applications, and configuring network devices. Ansible uses a declarative language, based on YAML (Yet Another Markup Language), to describe the desired state of a system.

The main idea behind Ansible is to provide a simple and agentless approach to automation. It connects to remote systems via SSH (Secure Shell) or other remote management protocols, without requiring any additional software or agents to be installed on the target systems. This makes it easy to use and lightweight compared to other configuration management tools.
